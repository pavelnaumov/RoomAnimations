# Animations for ROOM

There are two screens in this application: 
- Bubble-Picker &rarr; could be handy for a more interactive option for picking content for your React Native Application.
- A Volleyball that can be kicked around the screen, contained by the "virtual walls".

Both screens are made with OpenGL for React Native. The library has proven to be very powerful and efficient, giving a great result of 60FPS in both cases.
